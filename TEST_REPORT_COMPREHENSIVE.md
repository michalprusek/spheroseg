- **Key Issues**: 
  - Authentication flow failures
  - Element visibility timeouts
  - WebKit/Safari complete failures

## Key Findings

### 1. Import System Issues (Fixed)
- Successfully fixed EditMode import paths from '@spheroseg/types' to local imports
- Removed require() usage in vi.mocked() calls
- Added proper import statements for mocked hooks

### 2. TypeScript Compilation Errors (Critical)
- Backend: 56 test suites fail to run due to TS errors
- Missing exports: `getContainerInfo` from containerInfo module
- Type mismatches in rate limiting middleware
- Unknown type handling in error scenarios

### 3. Mock Infrastructure Issues
- React Context mocks now properly configured
- i18next and react-i18next mocks functioning
- axios mock structure fixed with proper AxiosError class

### 4. Test Infrastructure Improvements
- Created comprehensive test-setup.ts with all required mocks
- Added test utilities for rendering with providers
- Fixed timer mocks for tests using fake timers

## Critical Failures Analysis

### Frontend Test Failures (Top Categories)

1. **Worker Termination Errors** (30+ occurrences)
   - Polygon worker threads terminating unexpectedly
   - Missing proper cleanup in useEffect hooks

2. **Dialog Component Errors** (20 occurrences)
   - Element type invalid errors
   - Import/export mismatches

3. **Context Provider Errors** (Previously 74, now 0)
   - Successfully fixed all "useLanguage must be used within a LanguageProvider" errors

4. **API Mock Issues** (Previously 19, now resolved)
   - Fixed axios default export structure
   - Added proper AxiosError class implementation

### Backend Test Failures

1. **Module Import Errors**
   ```typescript
   Module '"../utils/containerInfo"' has no exported member 'getContainerInfo'
   ```

2. **Type Safety Issues**
   ```typescript
   'dbError' is of type 'unknown'
   Type '(_req: Request, _res: Response, next: NextFunction) => void' is not assignable
   ```

3. **Database Connection Issues**
   - Tests failing due to missing database connections
   - Pool closure methods not properly typed

### E2E Test Failures

1. **Authentication Tests**
   - Login form not showing expected error messages
   - Timeout waiting for invalid credential notifications
   - Dashboard redirect failures after login

2. **Browser Compatibility**
   - WebKit tests failing immediately (3ms duration)
   - Mobile Safari complete failure
   - Desktop browsers partially working (Chrome/Firefox)

## Progress Made

1. **Import System Fixes**
   - Reduced test failures from 351 to 314 (10.5% improvement)
   - Fixed all React Context provider errors
   - Resolved axios mock issues

2. **Test Infrastructure**
   - Created automated fix script for import issues
   - Established proper mock patterns
   - Added comprehensive test setup

3. **Coverage Setup**
   - Coverage enabled with v8 provider
   - Coverage reporting blocked by failing tests

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Fix TypeScript Compilation Errors**
   ```bash
   # Add missing exports
   echo "export { getContainerInfo } from './getContainerInfo';" >> packages/backend/src/utils/containerInfo/index.ts
   
   # Fix type issues in rate limiter
   # Update middleware signatures to match expected types
   ```

2. **Fix Worker Termination Issues**
   - Add proper cleanup in polygon worker hooks
   - Implement worker mock for test environment

3. **Fix Dialog Component Imports**
   - Audit all Dialog imports for consistency
   - Ensure proper default/named export patterns

### Long-term Improvements

1. **Test Organization**
   - Separate unit, integration, and E2E tests clearly
   - Create test categories for targeted execution

2. **Mock Management**
   - Centralize all mocks in dedicated directory
   - Create reusable mock factories

3. **Coverage Goals**
   - Current coverage cannot be calculated due to failures
   - Target: >80% coverage once tests are passing

## Test Execution Commands Used

```bash
# Frontend tests with fixes
npm test -- --run

# Integration tests
npm test -- --run src/__tests__/integration

# E2E tests
DISABLE_TEST_CACHE=1 npx playwright test --reporter=list

# Backend tests
cd packages/backend && npm test

# Coverage attempts (blocked by failures)
npm test -- --coverage --run
```

## Next Steps

1. **Priority 1**: Fix TypeScript compilation errors in backend
2. **Priority 2**: Resolve worker termination issues in frontend
3. **Priority 3**: Fix remaining import/export mismatches
4. **Priority 4**: Generate comprehensive coverage report
5. **Priority 5**: Fix E2E authentication flow tests

## Conclusion

While significant progress has been made in fixing test infrastructure issues (10.5% improvement in frontend tests), critical TypeScript compilation errors in the backend and worker termination issues in the frontend prevent full test suite execution. The test infrastructure is now more robust with proper mocks and setup, but approximately 314 frontend tests and 56 backend test suites still require fixes before achieving the target >80% coverage.
