# PR Split Strategy

## Current State
- PR #7 contains 303 changed files with both performance and i18n changes
- Need to split into manageable PRs

## Approach
1. Create feature branches from main
2. Cherry-pick relevant commits
3. Fix identified issues
4. Create separate PRs

## Branch Structure
1. feat/performance-optimizations
   - Database optimizations
   - React performance improvements
   - Backend caching
   - Performance monitoring (with auth fix)

2. feat/i18n-complete
   - Translation files updates
   - Translation coverage tests
   - i18n configuration fixes

## Issues to Fix
1. Add authentication to /api/performance/metrics endpoint
2. Extract magic numbers to configuration
3. Split large performanceMonitoring.ts file
4. Add memory leak tests

## Merge Order
1. First: i18n changes (lower risk)
2. Second: Performance optimizations (after thorough testing)
