console.log('1. Fixed image deletion for any image ID format (not just img-*)');
console.log('2. Ensured project image count is updated when images are deleted');
console.log('3. Fixed batch image upload to handle multiple files');

console.log('- Project image count is updated when images are added or deleted');
console.log('- Batch image upload now creates multiple image objects');
