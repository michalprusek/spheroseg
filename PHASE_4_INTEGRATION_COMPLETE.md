   - Regression testing framework
   - Custom benchmark definitions
   - Performance budget validation

4. **integration-testing.ts** - Cross-service testing coordination
   - Service health monitoring
   - Integration test orchestration
   - Network simulation capabilities
   - Database setup/teardown automation

### Framework Compatibility

| Service | Framework | Status | Features |
|---------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Backend | Jest | ‚úÖ Complete | Full mock factory, performance testing, integration tests |
| Frontend | Vitest | ‚úÖ Complete | React testing, component performance, i18n mocks |
| ML Service | Pytest | ‚úÖ Complete | Python wrappers, performance monitoring, health checks |

## üîß Technical Achievements

### 1. Framework Abstraction
Created unified APIs that work across Jest, Vitest, and Pytest, allowing consistent testing patterns across all services.

### 2. Language Bridge
Built Python wrappers that communicate with Node.js utilities via subprocess calls, enabling ML service integration with the shared infrastructure.

### 3. Graceful Degradation
All utilities handle missing dependencies gracefully:
- Node.js unavailable ‚Üí Python-only functionality
- Network issues ‚Üí Offline mode with local testing
- Missing packages ‚Üí Placeholder implementations

### 4. Performance Focus
Integrated performance monitoring at multiple levels:
- **Memory Usage**: Real-time tracking with container awareness
- **Execution Time**: High-precision timing for all operations
- **Regression Detection**: Automatic performance comparison against baselines

### 5. Cross-Service Testing
Enabled sophisticated integration testing:
- **Health Checks**: Automated service availability detection
- **Coordination**: Multi-service test orchestration
- **Dependency Management**: Proper setup/teardown across services
