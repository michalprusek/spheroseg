# Notification and Status Synchronization Fixes

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Duplicate Notifications
**Problem**: Users were seeing multiple "Image segmentation completed" notifications for the same event.

**Root Causes**:
- Multiple components dispatching the same WebSocket events
- Backend emitting to both project and image-specific rooms
- No deduplication mechanism in place

**Solutions Implemented**:
- Created centralized `segmentationEventManager` for event deduplication
- Added notification deduplication in `ProjectDetail.tsx` with 2-second window
- Removed duplicate event dispatching from `SegmentationQueueIndicator` and `ImageDisplay`
- Fixed backend to only emit to project room, not both rooms

### 2. Status Not Updating ("without_segmentation" stuck)
**Problem**: Images showed "without_segmentation" status even after segmentation completed.

**Root Cause**: 
- Backend was caching image list responses
- Cache wasn't invalidated when segmentation status changed
- Frontend would receive stale data on subsequent fetches

**Solution Implemented**:
- Added cache invalidation in segmentation routes:
  - When segmentation is queued
  - When segmentation completes (success or failure)
  - For both single and batch operations
- Added comprehensive debug logging to track status updates

### 3. 401 Authentication Errors
**Problem**: Queue status endpoints returning 401 errors, preventing status checks.

**Root Cause**: 
- Endpoints required authentication but were being called before login
- No mechanism for public queue status information

**Solution Implemented**:
- Changed queue endpoints to use `optionalAuthenticate` middleware
- Endpoints now work both authenticated and unauthenticated:
  - Authenticated: Shows user-specific queue data
  - Unauthenticated: Shows general queue statistics

## Files Modified

### Frontend
1. `packages/frontend/src/components/projects/ProjectDetail.tsx`
   - Added notification deduplication mechanism
   - Updated to use centralized event manager

2. `packages/frontend/src/services/segmentationEventManager.ts` (NEW)
   - Centralized event management with deduplication
   - Prevents duplicate events within 3-second window

3. `packages/frontend/src/components/queue/SegmentationQueueIndicator.tsx`
   - Disabled duplicate event dispatching

4. `packages/frontend/src/components/images/ImageDisplay.tsx`
   - Disabled duplicate event dispatching

5. `packages/frontend/src/hooks/useProjectImages.ts`
   - Added debug logging for status updates
   - Better WebSocket event handling

### Backend
1. `packages/backend/src/services/segmentationQueueService.ts`
   - Fixed duplicate WebSocket emissions
   - Now only emits to project room

2. `packages/backend/src/routes/segmentation.ts`
   - Added cache invalidation for all segmentation operations
   - Changed queue endpoints to optional authentication
   - Added user-aware queue status logic

## Testing the Fixes

### Verify Duplicate Notifications Fixed
1. Upload multiple images
2. Start segmentation
3. Should see only ONE notification per image completion

### Verify Status Updates
1. Upload an image
2. Click segment - status should change to "queued"
3. When complete - status should change to "completed"
4. No page refresh needed

### Verify Queue Status Works
1. Check browser console - no more 401 errors
2. Queue status endpoints work before login
3. After login, shows user-specific data

## Debug Logging

Enable browser console to see:
```
[useProjectImages] Received segmentation update: {...}
[useProjectImages] Updated image status: from X to Y
[useProjectImages] Fetched images: [...]
[SegmentationEventManager] Event already dispatched recently: {...}
```

## Performance Improvements

- Reduced WebSocket traffic by ~50% (no duplicate emissions)
- Fewer redundant API calls due to proper cache invalidation
- Better memory usage with event deduplication cleanup

## Future Improvements

1. Consider implementing a more sophisticated event bus
2. Add configurable deduplication windows
3. Implement server-side event deduplication
4. Add metrics for tracking duplicate events
