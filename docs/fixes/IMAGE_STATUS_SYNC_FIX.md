# Image Status Synchronization Fix Summary

## Problem
Images were showing "queued" status in the frontend even though they were already segmented (segmentation polygons were visible when opened).

## Root Causes

1. **Status Field Mismatch**: The backend uses `segmentation_status` (snake_case) in the database, but returns it as `segmentationStatus` (camelCase) in some endpoints
2. **Default Status**: The frontend was defaulting to 'pending' instead of 'without_segmentation' when status was missing
3. **Multiple Status Sources**: Two different endpoints were returning status differently:
   - `/api/projects/:id/images` - Returns status from images table
   - `/api/images/:id/segmentation` - Was returning status from segmentation_results table

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Frontend Status Mapping (projectImages.ts)
```typescript
// Before:
segmentationStatus: apiImage.segmentationStatus || apiImage.status || 'pending',

// After:
segmentationStatus: apiImage.segmentation_status || apiImage.segmentationStatus || apiImage.status || 'without_segmentation',
```

### 2. Type Definition Update (types/index.ts)
Added the snake_case field to the Image interface:
```typescript
segmentation_status?: string; // Database column name for segmentation status
```

### 3. Backend Consistency (segmentation.ts)
Modified `/api/images/:id/segmentation` endpoint to use the images table status as the source of truth (already implemented in previous fix).

### 4. Frontend Status Check (ImageDisplay.tsx)
- Removed comparison logic that was preventing status updates
- Simplified to always set the status from API response
- Removed currentStatus from useEffect dependencies to avoid infinite loops

## Status Flow

1. **Image Upload**: Status set to 'without_segmentation' in images table
2. **Queue for Segmentation**: Status updated to 'queued' in images table
3. **Processing**: Status updated to 'processing' in images table
4. **Completion**: Status updated to 'completed' in images table
5. **Frontend Display**: 
   - Initial load from project images list
   - Verified via `/api/images/:id/segmentation` call
   - Updated via WebSocket events
   - Polled every 5 seconds for queued/processing images

## Testing Recommendations

1. Upload a new image and verify it shows 'without_segmentation'
2. Queue it for segmentation and verify it shows 'queued'
3. Wait for processing and verify it shows 'processing'
4. After completion, verify it shows 'completed' with visible polygons
5. Refresh the page and verify status persists correctly

## Additional Improvements Made

1. **Cancel Segmentation Tasks**: Added ability to cancel tasks from queue indicator
2. **Transparent Thumbnails**: Changed segmentation overlays to transparent with colored strokes
3. **Queue Indicator UI**: Shows detailed task list with cancel buttons
4. **Polling Improvements**: Added polling for QUEUED status, not just PROCESSING
