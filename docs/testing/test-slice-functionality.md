# Slice Functionality Test

## Changes Made

1. **Added `useSlicing` hook import** to SegmentationPage.tsx
2. **Added `useSlicing` hook usage** with all required props
3. **Added `setSegmentationDataWithHistory` to destructuring** from useSegmentationV2
4. **Added useEffect to trigger slice** when:
   - editMode === EditMode.Slice
   - tempPoints.length === 2
   - selectedPolygonId is set

## Expected Behavior

1. User selects a polygon
2. User enters Slice mode (press 'S' or click slice tool)
3. User clicks first point on the polygon
4. User clicks second point
5. After second click, the slice should automatically execute after 100ms delay
6. The polygon should be split into two polygons
7. Success toast should appear
8. Mode should return to View mode

## Console Logs to Watch For

- `[Slice Mode] Setting first slice point`
- `[Slice Mode] Setting second slice point`
- `[Slice Mode] Complete slice line`
- `[SegmentationPage] Slice points ready, triggering slice action`
- `[SegmentationPage] Calling handleSliceAction now`
- `[handleSliceAction] Called with:`
- `[handleSliceAction] Attempting to slice polygon:`
- `[SegmentationPage] Slice action completed successfully` (if successful)

## Test Steps

1. Run the application
2. Navigate to a segmentation page with polygons
3. Select a polygon by clicking on it
4. Press 'S' to enter slice mode
5. Click two points to define the slice line
6. Observe the console logs and verify the polygon is sliced
