## 📋 Recommendations & Action Items

### 🔥 High Priority (Fix Immediately)

**1. Fix Backend Test Configuration**
```bash
# Issues to resolve:
- Update import/export syntax in service files
- Fix TypeScript module declarations
- Configure test database connection
- Repair service instantiation in tests
```

**2. Stabilize Authentication Tests**
```typescript
// Current issue: Tests expecting specific values but getting fallbacks
// Solution: Improve mock configuration and async handling
expect(screen.getByTestId('user-id')).toHaveTextContent('user-123');
// Received: 'fallback-user-id'
```

**3. Address JSX Transform Issues**
```bash
# Fix: Ensure .tsx extensions for JSX-containing test utilities
# Status: Partially resolved, may need additional configuration
```

### 🎯 Medium Priority (Next Sprint)

**4. Enhance Test Coverage**
- Target: Increase success rate from 72.8% to 85%

- Implement parallel test execution
- Optimize test environment setup (currently 105.60s)

**6. Implement Continuous Health Monitoring**
```typescript
// Set up automated health reporting
const healthMonitor = TestHealthMonitor.getInstance();
// Generate daily/weekly health reports
// Track trends and regressions
```

### 🚀 Low Priority (Future Enhancement)
